# FYS4150 - Computational Physics
This is the public repository for the master-subject FYS4150 at the University of Oslo.
This course is an introduction to numerical methods which are used in solving problems in physics and chemistry, including solutions of differential equations, matrix operations and eigenvalue problems, interpolation and numerical integration, modeling of data and Monte Carlo methods.
The subject consists of five main projects, where you will find more information resting within each repository.

# Project 1

## Ordinary Differential Equations \& Linear Algebra
This project looks at methods of solving ordinary differential equations and converting them into a linear algebra problem.

This project is the product of the collaboration between Marius Enga, Mohamed Ismail, Patryk Krzyzaniak \& Kristoffer Varslott.

# Project 2

## Eigenvalue Problems
The aim of this project is to develop our own code for solving eigenvalue problems.

This project is the product of the collaboration between Marius Enga, Mohamed Ismail, Patryk Krzyzaniak \& Kristoffer Varslott.

# Project 3

## Numerical Integration
The goal of this project is to study different methods within numerical integration. The methods that are studied are Gauss-Legendre Quadrature, Gaussâ€“Laguerre Quadrature \& Monte Carlo.

This project is the product of the collaboration between Marius Enga, Mohamed Ismail, Patryk Krzyzaniak \& Kristoffer Varslott.

# Project 4

## Statistical Physics \& the Ising Model
In this project we will use the widely popular Ising model to study the phase transitions in a magnetic system.

This project is the product of the collaboration between Mohamed Ismail \& Jens Bratten Due.


# Project 5

## Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations 
In this project we want to study the numerical stability of three methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). The methods we will study are the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolsen

This project is the product of the collaboration between Mohamed Ismail \& Jens Bratten Due.
